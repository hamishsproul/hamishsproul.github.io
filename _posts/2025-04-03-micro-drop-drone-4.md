# Update
For the past few months, I have been mostly focused on other tasks. During the time I spent on this project, I explored writing Python scripts that create low gravity conditions. My most recent Python script could get the drone's acceleration down to around 0 m/s<sup>2</sup> but only for a few hundredths of a second. The thrust would increase quickly, suggesting there was an issue with the logic in the script. I may continue with the Python script approach in the future.

But this approach has an elephant in the room. The Python script runs on the ground control stations (GCS), and not on the drone. The script uses telemetry transmitted by the drone and transmits MAVLink commands to control the drone all over the radio link . This naturally adds some delay reducing responsiveness, and if the radio communication is patchy or drops out, the drone's low gravity manoeuvre stops. 

To increase performance and reliability, the script should run on the drone itself. There are two ways to do this:
1. Add a companion computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) that runs the script and sends MAVLink commands via a physical connection to the FC.
2. Run the script on the FC.

Option 1 adds more cost and complexity so will only be explored if necessary. Option 2 is simpler. Flight controllers such as the Pixhawk have some flash memory to run scripts, but it's limited (2-4 MB). The ArduPilot community have implemented Lua scripting methods that allow users to run scripts directly on their FC. Lua was chosen since its lighter compared to similar Python scripts, meeting the constraints of the FC's flash. 

# Lua Scripts
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is an... interesting language to use. For scripts to run in conjunction with ArduPilot, Lua is useful since its pretty readable (feels similar to Python in that sense) and light enough to run on a Pixhawk.

The ArduPilot community have created their own Lua methods to communicate with ArduPilot FC software, so writing scripts for the average user is much easier. [The ArduPilot page for Lua scripts](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-lua-scripts.html) is a good place to start but can be outdated. It's best to check the available methods in the [Lua doc](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Scripting/docs/docs.lua) in ArduPilot's repo. I'll refer to this as the golden list.

## Useful Methods
I first needed to know what methods were useful for my application. I went through the golden list, picked out interesting methods, and tested them in isolation in Mission Planner (see next section). The following methods are useful:
- `baro:get_altitude()` <- get the altitude relative to the initial altitude (when the drone was powered on)
- `ahrs:get_location()` <- returns a location object that includes altitude data
- `ahrs:get_velocity_NED()` <- get the velocity vector of the drone in the NED frame
- `ins:get_accel(0)` <- get the acceleration of the drone from the IMU (note this is in the drone's body frame)
- `motors:get_throttle()` <- get the throttle (0-1) of the drone's motors
- `arming:is_armed()` <- check if the drone is armed
- `battery:capacity_remaining_pct(0)` <- check the battery percentage of the drone
- `gcs:send_text(0, "LGM: " .. message)` <- send a message to the ground control station (with the prefix LGM:)

## Testing Lua Scripts with Mission Planner
Mission Planner is a ground control station software that is able to run SITL simulations like that described in my [last post](/_posts/2024-12-16-micro-drop-drone-3.md). Go to the Simulation tab and select Multirotor. You will need to download the data the first time but can select Skip Download in the drop down box for future runs of the SITL.
![](/assets/images/mdd_blog_post_4/mdd_MP_1.png "Starting an SITL simulation using Mission Planner.")
Once running, navigate to Config, MAVFtp, click the + to open the folder, then double click scripts. If this scripts folder doesn't exist, you will need to create it. Here, you can add your Lua scripts by right clicking and select upload.
![](/assets/images/mdd_blog_post_4/mdd_MP_2.png "Uploading Lua scripts to your SITL instance.")
Then you need to restart the SITL for the drone to boot with the loaded Lua script. A quick way to do this is press `ctrl + F`, click reboot Pixhawk, wait a few seconds until the drone disconnects, then click connect in the top right corner. This doesn't always work, so you may need to just disconnect and restart the SITL like at the beginning. When the SITL drone starts up, the script will be active.


# LGM v1
With the help of Anthropic's Claude, I put together a v1 of a Low Gravity Manoeuvre script written in Lua. This script, `lgm_v1.lua`, is structured as a state machine. The drone starts of in an IDLE state and only transitions to other states when conditions have been met (such as flight checks). This structure allows easy implementation of parallel states such as an abort state if, say, the drone is too low or or moving too fast.

This version has the foundation for an lgm script, but its control algorithm to achieve low gravity is very simple. It starts with a low thrust during the low gravity phase and increases the thrust by a small amount if the acceleration is too low and decreases the thrust if the acceleration is too high.

The graph below shows the vertical acceleration, velocity and altitude of a proxy drone during the low gravity phase when controlled by this lgm_v1.lua.
![](/assets/images/mdd_blog_post_4/flight_data_plot_v1_data_2.png "Flight data of a proxy drone being controlled by lgm_v1.lua.")
The acceleration hovers around 0.5 g's, which, while lower than 1 g, is not considered low gravity (typically below 0.1 g's). The next steps of this project is to implement more effective control algorithms that achieve low gravity conditions. In my next post, I'll also explain more about the design of these lgm scripts.
