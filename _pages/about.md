Welcome to my website! This is a space for me to share my projects, ideas, and insights across various STEM fields. While I’m particularly passionate about the space industry, my interests extend to education and other areas of STEM. You’ll find a mix of content here, ranging from space-related applications to educational resources and explorations in science and technology.

I have a strong foundation in science education, specializing in physics, paired with a deep enthusiasm for space technology. I’m currently transitioning into a career in the space industry. Through this site, I hope to document my journey, share my experiences, and inspire others to share their ideas or take on a STEM project.
